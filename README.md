## BROWSER LOADED WITH FEATURES


</div>

### Description

Not just any old web browser. I have yet to find a web browser on here that I would consider using above Internet Explorer. I believe that I have created one. This is my first submission to planet source code, simply because I see alot of garbage on here and I did not want to pollute this site with anything less than decent code. My browser supports favorites connecting to an access database. There are 4 options for your homepage, last saved page, current page, type in an URL, or a feature that I added to choose a random page from your list of favorites. Each user will login and have their on favorites saved for them along with their settings. My browser also supports history, blocking pop-ups, plus other features. I also demonstrate form manipulation and error handling. Please vote and leave me some feedback, this is my first submission and will submit more if everyone likes this. You will need msflxgrd.ocx, but I believe that is a standard issue to all versions of VB. I included it in the zip, but I think planet source code will delete it. My name is Ken so I titled the browser appropriately as KenScape Navigator.
